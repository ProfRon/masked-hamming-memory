# `hamming`

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/huonw/hamming.png)](https://travis-ci.org/huonw/hamming) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/huonw/hamming/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/huonw/hamming)

A rust crate to implement Bernd Klauer's MHD (Masked Hamming Distance) Associative Memory (more or less) in Rust -- building on Huonw's excellent "hamming" crate.

Huonw's original "Readme" was as follows:

> A crate to compute the
> [Hamming weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight) of a
> vector and the
> [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)
> between two efficiently. This supports `no_std` environments.
>
> [Documentation](http://docs.rs/hamming), [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/hamming).
