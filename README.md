# `Masked Hamming Memory`

A rust crate to implement Bernd Klauer's MHD (Masked Hamming Distance) Associative Memory (more or less) in Rust -- building on Huonw's excellent "hamming" crate.

## Inspiration

Literature references concering Klauer's MHD Memory are gathered in the [MHD-References bibtex file](MHD-References.bib).

Huonw's code repository is at <https://github.com/huonw/hamming>.

Huonw's original "Readme" was (and is, as of this writing) as follows:

> vector and the
> [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)
> between two efficiently. This supports `no_std` environments.
